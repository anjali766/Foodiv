# FooDiv

--Foodiv is a recipe management application built using React JS, designed to help users manage their favorite recipes by adding, editing, and marking them as favorites. The app showcases key JavaScript and React concepts such as local state management, click handlers, conditional rendering, and event bubbling. 

--The main page features a navigation bar with links to the Home and Add Recipe pages, a recipe list where each recipe is displayed in a card format with the title, a brief description, and an "Add to Favorite" button. Users can click on a recipe title to view detailed information about the recipe, including ingredients, steps, and tags. 

--The favorite recipes section is displayed below the main recipe list, allowing users quick access to their favorite dishes.

--The recipe detail page shows full recipe information and includes an edit button that opens the form with pre-filled data for easy updates. The add/edit recipe form allows users to input a recipe title, description, ingredients, and steps, and provides a checkbox or select input for tags. A save button is available to either add a new recipe or update an existing one. Foodiv provides an efficient and user-friendly way to organize and manage personal recipes.
